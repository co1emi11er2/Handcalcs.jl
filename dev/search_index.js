This package supplies macros to generate LaTeX formatted strings from mathmatical formulas. This package takes inspiration from handcalcs.py which is a python package that works best in jupyter notebooks. The goal is to get the functionalities of that package and bring them to Julia. The current version of Handcalcs.jl is working for typical algebraic formulas. Future plans are to integrate the package with Unitful.jl, be able to render the algebraic expressions within a function, and many other things. This package is an extension of Latexify.jl. The @latexdefine macro is similar to the main @handcalcs macro, but instead of only a symbolic rendering it also renders the numeric substitution.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Note: This package now renders properly in Quarto/Weave!!
